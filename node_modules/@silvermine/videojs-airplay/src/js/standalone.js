 * This module is used as an entry point for the build system to bundle this plugin into a

 * file that is built assumes that `videojs` is available globally at `window.videojs`, so
 * Video.js must be loaded **before** this plugin is loaded.
 *
 * Run `npm install` and then `grunt build` to build the plugin's bundled javascript
 * file, as well as the CSS and image assets into the project's `./dist/` folder.
